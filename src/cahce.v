//FILE:         cache.v
//VERSION:      0.3
//DESCRIPTION:  This file implemented the cache module.
//              
//              Features
//              *Cache is automatically synced from the BUS*
//              Cache will monitor all write requests on the bus (except write 
//              requests issued by itself). 
//
//              *Cache request can be canceled without causing a bus error*
//              The Bus controller is a simple one, it can't process the revoke
//              operation. The cancellation mechanism can ensure that when the 
//              request is sent to the bus, the request will not be cancelled but 
//              wait until the request is completed.
//
//              * Request on cached data only need one clock cycle *
//              This feature is adapted for our five-stage pipeline and delay 
//              slot for branch.
//
//              * 2-way set associate configuration *
//              The implementation here has a 2-way set associate configuration,
//              most of the storage should be implemented by on board RAM of FPGA,
//              the valid RAM is implemented by registers due to lack of clear
//              support of on board RAM.
//              
//              * Customize no cache range *
//              This feature is used for memory mapped IO and DMA access. Memory
//              in this range is not cached. (param no_cache_start & no_cache_end)
//
//              * Write Policy is Write through *
//
//              Some tricky problems.
//              1.How to make data ready in one clock.
//              If there's a cache hit, data is ready in only one clock; If there's
//              a cache miss, data is ready whenever the bus is ready. It is a 
//              little tricky to achieve this, but it is necessary. If cache hits,
//              CPU is not stalled, the data must be ready in one clock, since we 
//              have a five-stage pipeline, and only one delay slot when branch. 
//              If the data can't be ready when cache hits in one cycle, we have to
//              change the design of the pipeline and the number of delay slot. I 
//              don't want to change them, so I did my best to make the cache ready 
//              in one clock when there's a cache hit. 
//              To achieve this, the feature of the onboard RAM of FPGA must be 
//              considered, input ports of the onboard RAM have build-in registers.
//              This makes the timing task a little bit tricky. If we use a delicate
//              PC or EXE-MEM stage register, there will be a clock delay due to this
//              internal register; if we directly connect the onboard RAM to next pc
//              or exe stage, we can't handle the stall of cpu, since next pc changes
//              continuously, we can't stop that. So there must be an mechanism to 
//              help the cache to distinguish the state of CPU. If there's a new cpu
//              cycle, the input of onboard ram should be connected directly to the
//              next PC or EXE stage; if cpu is stalled, the input of onboard ram 
//              should be connected to the stage pipeline register, ie PC or EXE-MEM
//              stage register. So I use the cpu stall signal to select input of on
//              board ram. If the stall signal is HIGH, it means cpu is waiting, the
//              input of onboard ram should be the old (registered) value; if stall
//              signal is LOW, it means this is a new instruction, the input of onboard
//              ram should be the new value (directly connected to the next pc or exe).
//              2.Avoid logic loop
//              Because the address input has additional combinational logic to select
//              between direct or registered value, Stall signal is based on cache ready
//              design can easily trap in to combinational logic loop. To avoid this
//              I did some debug, Carefully distinguish which signals should be placed 
//              in registers.
